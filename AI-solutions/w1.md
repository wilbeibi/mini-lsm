## Day 1
Implemented the MemTable functionality:
- Created MemTable initialization with create
- Implemented put to add key-value pairs to the memtable
- Implemented get to retrieve values from the memtable
- Added size tracking to monitor memtable growth

Implemented the LSM Storage functionality:
- Added get to retrieve values from both the active and immutable memtables
- Implemented put to add key-value pairs to the active memtable
- Implemented delete as a special case of put with an empty value (tombstone)
- Implemented force_freeze_memtable to move the active memtable to the immutable list
- Added capacity checking to automatically freeze memtables when they get too large

Added safeguards:
- Added proper handling of locking to prevent race conditions
- Implemented correct tombstone handling (empty values) for deletions

The implementation passed all the tests for Week 1 Day 1, establishing the basic in-memory functionality of the LSM tree storage engine. In the next day's tasks, you'll likely implement the iterator functionality to scan ranges of keys.
